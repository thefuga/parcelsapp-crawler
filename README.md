# Parcels App Crawler
This is a silly automation to track parcels from Parcels App from the terminal, 
allowing stuff like formatting with JQ, TMUX and Polybar visualization, and so on.

## How to use it?
- Copy the `config.example.json` file to `config.json` and fill it with the proper values.
- Build the app (`go build main.go`) or simply run it with `go run main.go`.

### Requirements
- Go 1.19 (>1.15 should do it)
- Node 16
